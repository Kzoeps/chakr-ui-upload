# Chakra-UI-Upload

Really Simple Drag and Drop input for chakra UI. Mostly copy pasta from rc-upload and still a wip. Use at your own risk.

Features:
- [x] Drag and Drop
- [x] Drag and drop multiple
- [x] Drag and drop accept attributes
- [x] animation on hover
- [x] show uploaded file list

Future Work
- [ ] more styling options
- [ ] automatic upload by providing API endpoint
- [ ] addition of files and removal communication has to be improved(maybe a hook for this?)
- [ ] directory drop
